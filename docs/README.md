# phax/language-detection
This is a language detection library implemented in plain Java. Forked from https://github.com/kirasystems/language-detection which in turn is a fork from https://github.com/shuyo/language-detection

This version uses a Maven POM to build and contains some speed and coding styleguide improvements.
